                "Peaches" is a song by American actor and musician Jack Black,
                released as a single on April 7, 2023. The song was written as
                part of the soundtrack for the Super Mario Bros. movie, in which
                Black's character, Bowser, performs the piano ballad to secretly
                confess his love for Princess Peach. The song debuted on the US
                Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 83, becoming Black's first
                solo single to enter the chart. The Spanish version for
                Spanish-speaking audiences is performed by HÃ©ctor Estrada.

              <h2>Concept</h2>
              <p>
                The musical background for Bowser was not present in the first
                draft of the movie. Aaron Horvath, one of the co-directors, told
                GameSpot that he wanted a musical Bowser, but planned a more
                metal-themed song in the vein of Tenacious D. After realizing it
                would be boring for Bowser to simply say "I love Princess
                Peach," Horvath decided to tell the song through a ballad. The
                original demo was recorded with Eric Osmond on vocals. Two days
                later, Black completed the final recording of the song with an
                original piano track from his pianist.
