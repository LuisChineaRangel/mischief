            <h2 class="my-4">1. Personal identification information:</h2>
            <p>
              We may collect personal identification information from Users in
              various ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our
              Site, register on the Site, subscribe to the newsletter, respond
              to a survey, fill out a form, and in connection with other
              activities, services, features, or resources we make available on
              our Site. Users may be asked for, as appropriate, name, email
              address. Users may, however, visit our Site anonymously. We will
              collect personal identification information from Users only if
              they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always
              refuse to supply personal identification information, except that
              it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site-related
              activities.
            </p>
            <h2 class="my-4">2. Non-personal identification information:</h2>
            <p>
              We may collect non-personal identification information about Users
              whenever they interact with our Site. Non-personal identification
              information may include the browser name, the type of computer,
              and technical information about Users' means of connection to our
              Site, such as the operating system and the Internet service
              providers utilized, and other similar information.
            </p>
            <h2 class="my-4">3. Web browser cookies:</h2>
            <p>
              Our Site may use "cookies" to enhance the User experience. User's
              web browser places cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping
              purposes and sometimes to track information about them. Users may
              choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies or to alert you
              when cookies are being sent. If they do so, note that some parts
              of the Site may not function properly.
            </p>
            <h2 class="my-4">4. How we use collected information:</h2>
            <p>
              mischief may collect and use Users' personal information for the
              following purposes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                To personalize user experience: We may use information in the
                aggregate to understand how our Users as a group use the
                services and resources provided on our Site.
              </li>
              <li>
                To send periodic emails: We may use the email address to respond
                to inquiries, questions, and/or other requests from Users. If a
                User decides to opt-in to our mailing list, they will receive
                emails that may include company news, updates, related product
                or service information, etc. If at any time the User would like
                to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed
                unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="my-4">5. How we protect your information:</h2>

            <p>
              We do not sell, trade, or rent Users' personal identification
              information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic
              information not linked to any personal identification information
              regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted
              affiliates, and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.
