                Making an opinion about SoulsBorne is the Dark Souls of
                newsrooms. This saga and its iconic company FromSoftware are not
                known for the difficulty of their games, but also for the
                mechanics that surround them: Leaving the player at ease to
                explore the dangers of their worlds without compassion just like
                the worlds of their games, punishing mistakes like a tough
                teacher.

                <strong>So what is the point?</strong> The answer is very
                simple: just like life itself, the important thing is not the
                destination but the route.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each monster, boss, trap, obstacle in our way is what adds to
                our experience in the world to adapt, improve, have empathy for
                the characters, friends and enemies that share our same journey,
                until we reach our final goal; Whether it's saving the world,
                ruling them all, rescuing an old friend... And speaking of
                friends and enemies!
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the things that made me fall in love with this company is
                the perfect balance between good and evil that tarnishes its
                characters. And it is that sometimes it is very difficult to
                classify a character as "good" or "evil" in a world as miserable
                and cruel as that of the Souls.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many will attack us simply to steal our resources, or because we
                are in the way, but that does not define the morale of many
                characters; some are lost or corrupted, others are just trying
                to protect their loved ones, no matter how vile their actions
                may have been. On the contrary, some will seem friendly and will
                even help us on our adventure, only to end up discovering that
                they hide the vilest and most despicable goals in the world, no
                matter how well we get along with them.
              </p>
              <p>
                You are not alone,
                <strong
                  >each character has embarked on a journey before you</strong
                >
                (an aspect that is reinforced above all in the absolute climax
                of the Dark Souls saga). Like the players, many will die or quit
                midway, others will achieve their goals, but in the end, they
                will also be part of YOUR journey. That's what a SoulsBorne is.
