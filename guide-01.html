              <h1>Beginner's guide: how to play Pokemon Platinum</h1>
              <h2>Introduction:</h2>
              <p>
                If you're new to the world of Pokemon, it can be overwhelming to
                start with the Platinum version. However, this guide will help
                you understand the basic concepts of the game so you can start
                enjoying this adventure in the Sinnoh region.
              </p>
              <h2>Development:</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Choose your starter Pokemon
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      When you start the game, you'll have to choose from three
                      options: Turtwig (grass type), Chimchar (fire type), and
                      Piplup (water type). Each of them has their own abilities
                      and weaknesses, so make sure to choose the one that best
                      suits your play style.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Explore the Sinnoh region
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      The Sinnoh region is vast and there are many places you
                      can explore. From the different cities to the routes and
                      caves, there's a lot to discover. Talk to people to get
                      information and discover new missions.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Catch new Pokemon
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      In Pokemon Platinum, there are over 150 different Pokemon
                      you can catch. You can find them in tall grass or in the
                      water using Poke Balls. Make sure to weaken the Pokemon
                      before attempting to catch it, and bring enough Poke Balls
                      so you don't run out in the middle of a capture.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Train your Pokemon
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      To make your Pokemon stronger, you'll need to train them.
                      Use the experience points they earn in battle to level up
                      and improve their stats. You can also teach them new moves
                      and make them evolve.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Battle other trainers
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      On your adventure, you'll encounter other trainers who
                      also have Pokemon. Challenge them to battles to gain
                      experience, money, and items. Make sure to bring enough
                      healing items and have a varied team to face different
                      types of Pokemon.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Defeat gym leaders
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      In each city, there's a gym leader that you'll have to
                      defeat in a battle to earn a badge. You'll need a strong
                      and strategic team to defeat them all.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Face the Pokemon League
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Once you've obtained all the gym badges, you can access
                      the Pokemon League. Face the best trainers in the region
                      to become the League Champion.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
