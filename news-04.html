                One of the most vocal public figures pushing for the closure of
                the Activision Blizzard deal with Microsoft is Bobby Kotick, who
                has criticized regulators on more than one occasion. These
                entities are the main reason why Microsoft's acquisition has not
                yet been finalized. However, there is a reason behind all his
                insistence: money.
              </p>
              <p>
                According to Tweaktown, the CEO of Activision Blizzard could
                make a fortune if the Microsoft acquisition goes through. It
                would be a total of 185 million dollars, but he would not be the
                only one seeing his pockets filled with cash, as the top
                executives of Activision would also benefit from the purchase
                offer of $95 per share of the company.
              </p>
              <p>
                Kotick has 4.3 million shares in Activision Blizzard, but he
                also has the right to acquire another 2.2 million, as commented
                by Stephen Totilo, a journalist at Axios. In addition, if you
                are one of those who thinks that Microsoft should withdraw from
                Great Britain, you should know that it would be losing more than
                800 million dollars annually if it does not sell its games in
                that territory, something totally unfeasible, as discovered by
                TweakTown.
              </p>
              <h2>What happens if Bobby Kotick is fired?</h2>
              <p>
                The story changes a lot, and Bobby Kotick probably wouldn't mind
                being fired considering all the money he would make. He could
                earn more than 290 million dollars, but that's not all. If
                Microsoft fails in its attempt to acquire Activision Blizzard,
                it is very likely that Bobby Kotick will remain in his position
                at the company, as reported by FOX Business.
